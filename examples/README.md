## `hetGPy` Examples

*   This directory contains a sequence of `hetGPy` tutorials and examples.

### Numbered Tutorials
*   These notebooks follow a sequence from Intro -> Advanced usage, where `00-hetGPy-Intro` introuces the mathematical background and general syntax of the library, and `06-Sequential-Design` walks through an advanced example of large-scale modeling with a sophisticated acquisition function.



### Extra Tutorials

An additional set of notebooks are available in the `extra` folder which cover other use cases (at differing levels of complexity from the numbered tutorials)



Note that to run these examples you may need auxillary (but still common to scientific Python) libraries such as `matplotlib`.
